## Usage

`chaas` will run and check if your PR contains a Changelog.

### Configuration

Add a `.chaas.yml` file to your project root.

- Options
    - `version {Number}`: `chaas` major version. 
        - *Default*: `1`.
    - `ignore {Array}`: A list of files/globs to ignore files in PRs. If your PR contains **only** files ignored then `chaas` will report as `NEUTRAL`.
        - *Default*: `[]`.
        - **example**: If you don't want `chaas` to report when you only commit changes for markdown files:
        ```yml
            ignore: [ "**/*.md" ]
        ```

## Development 

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot (locally)
npm run dev 
```
